## Description

The code is for a salary calculator website where you can add employees and their details (such as name, ID, title, and annual salary) to a table. The website calculates the total annual salary of all employees added and displays it at the bottom of the table.

If the total annual salary is over $20,000, the background of the total annual salary cell turns red.

You can also delete individual employees from the table by clicking on the "Delete" button next to their information.
